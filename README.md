# Anki Deck Ideas
A list of ideas for cards to add to an Anki deck.

<a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> is a program that allows you to make and review flashcards.

I've been using it to review syntax and other CS concepts.

While there are <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">ways to share decks</a> it's not a perfect system. You don't really know what's in a shared deck until you download it, and if you're just starting to learn about a subject a deckfull of flashcards on topics you haven't gotten to yet isn't very helpful.

The idea of this repo is a list of card ideas that someone can use as a guide or inspiration for making their own custom decks.

##Guidelines
Every card contains a front and a back.

The front should be in the form of a simple question, ie:<br />
<code>How do you declare an integer?</code>

And the back should have the answer, ie:<br />
<code>int <em>variableName</em> = <em>someValue</em>;</code>

Placeholder text (things that the programmer would change as needed) should be in itallics.

Try and keep things easy to read and generic enough for anyone who's studying to use.
